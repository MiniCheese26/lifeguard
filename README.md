Helping you to keep an eye on all your mining pools

## What is this?

I recently got into Ethereum mining (with some RavenCoin on the side) and wanted to create an app to keep all my different mining pool
stats in a single place.

## My First Flutter App

I've never used Flutter or Dart or touched Android development at all so this is a way for me to dip my toes in.
So, if you're more experienced and see some glaring oversights or inefficiencies feel free to create a PR!
